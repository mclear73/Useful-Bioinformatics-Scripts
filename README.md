## Useful-Bioinformatics-Scripts ##

This is meant to be a collection of basic, but useful linux commands for bioinformatics analysis. I am also using this to deposit my python library of useful bioinformatics tools. 

See the [Python_Bioinformatics_Library_Manual](https://github.com/mclear73/Useful-Bioinformatics-Scripts/blob/main/Python_BioInformatics_Library_Manual.md) for more information about the functions and their usage
